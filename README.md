# Local.LLM

Local.LLM is a community-focused LLM platform, featuring many apps and quick updates.

### Self Hosting

## Requirements

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   
## Setup

There are 2 different types of self-hosted servers:

Local - No credits system, certain apps accessible.

Non-Local - Credits system, certain apps inaccessible (this is the type our hosted server uses).

You can switch between them in the .env file by setting local to true.

Either do the automatic installation (via the Oxygen Low's Software app), or follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Oxygen-Low/Local.LLM)
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start

## Extra Information
Local.LLM is made and developed by Oxygen Low's Software, and is also available in the Oxygen Low's Software app for installation and usage under the utilities category.

It is a project solely focused on providing tools that are usually paid for, for free, either locally hosted or using our servers.
